For upgrading the image, we have a bin file of the older image. Let us copy that .bin file to the directory we have created.

`cp ~/test/bdcatalog-centos7-bluedata-spark221-1.0.bin ~/Source`{{execute}}


Now, Make the .bin file executable by executing the following command
`cd Source`{{execute}}
`chmod +x bdcatalog-centos7-bluedata-spark221-1.0.bin`{{execute}}
